		<h1 class="header">Disadvantages of Plastic Pollution</h1>
		<p>Plastic is incredibly useful because of its low cost of manufacture and cheap availability, but it has a lot of flaws, and its detrimental effects are a major source of concern for us as we try to rescue our planet and ourselves. The following are a few of its drawbacks:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Plastic can take 400-1000 years to decompose naturally, and some forms of plastic are non-degradable.</li>
			<li>Plastics pollute canals, oceans, seas, and lakes, among other places. Marine litter has entangled one out of every three species of marine animals.</li>
			<li>Many animals die after consuming plastic materials. Plastic fragments are found in the stomachs of almost 90% of all seabirds.</li>
			<li>In packaging, plastic is commonly utilised. Eating meals from plastic containers has been linked to cancer.</li>
			<li>Plastic production and recycling both emit hazardous gases and residues, polluting the air, water, and land.</li>
			<li>A few compounds, such as phthalates, that are added to plastics to prevent their structure from breaking down, may cause major hormone imbalance in both males and females.</li>
			<li>Many fire hazards are caused by plastic.</li>
			<li>Its recycling costs are likewise very expensive.</li>
