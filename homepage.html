		<h3>What is Plastic Pollution?</h3>
		<img src="plastic pollution.jpg" class="img-1">
		<p>As the world's ability to cope with the fast rising manufacturing of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world's ability to deal with them, plastic pollution has become one of the most important environmental challenges. Plastic pollution is especially noticeable in impoverished Asian and African countries, where rubbish collection systems are sometimes ineffective or non-existent. However, the industrialised world, particularly in countries with poor recycling rates, has difficulty collecting discarded plastics properly. Plastic waste has become so pervasive that efforts are underway to draught a global treaty that will be negotiated by the United Nations.</p>
		<h3>How has this occured?</h3>
		<p>Plastics made from fossil fuels have only been around for a century. Following WWII, the production and creation of thousands of new plastic goods skyrocketed, altering the modern era to the point that living without plastics would be unrecognisable today. Plastics changed medicine with life-saving gadgets, enabled space exploration, lightened vehicles and aircraft, reducing fuel use and pollution, and saved lives with helmets, incubators, and equipment for safe drinking water.

However, the conveniences that plastics provide have resulted in a throw-away culture that exposes the material's dark side: single-use plastics now account for 40% of all plastic manufactured each year.</p>
